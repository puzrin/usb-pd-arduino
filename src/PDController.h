/**
 * USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) controller.
 *
 * Using this controller, power delivery can be monitored or controlled.
 * This class supports the basic features for participating as power sink
 * or monitoring USB-PD communication (passively).
 *
 * A single global instance of this class exists. It is called 'PowerController'.
 *
 * USB-PD communication is asynchronous. Thus this class provides two means to
 * inform client code about events.
 *
 * - Client code can register an event handler function, which will be called on events,
 * e.g. if a message has been received or the power supplied has be disconnected.
 * The callback handler will be called from an interrupt handler. Thus it must
 * not block execution, e.g. by writing to serial output.
 *
 * - This class also writes low-level events to a log (with a circular buffer).
 * Client code can read the log entries and then process them. These log
 * entries are rather low-level, e.g. they include the GoodCRC messages, which
 * are used to confirm each non-GoodCRC message.
 *
 * As USB PD communication is timing sensitive, most code will run as part of
 * an interrupt handler.
 * 
 * The template parameters control if the controller needs to send GoodCRC messages
 * and/or retry transmissions that have not been acknowledged, or if it is
 * handled automatically by the underlying PHY.
 * 
 * @tparam AUTO_GOOD_CRC 'true' if PHY sends GoodCRC messages automatically, 'false' otherwise
 * @tparam AUTO_TX_RETRY 'true' if PHY retries transmissions automatically if no GoodCRC is received, 'false' otherwise
